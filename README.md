# Fizzbuzz with Java

Fizzbuzz is a [code kata](http://codekata.com), a simple coding challenge where the goal of this kata is to learn the java programming languange, using test driven development (TDD) with Junit5. The task was to create a simple program/algorithm with the following specifications:  

* The program can be passed a number.
* When passed a number that is a multiple of 3, the program returns the message 'Fizz'.
* When passed a number that is a multiple of 5, the program returns the message 'Buzz'.
* When passed a number that is a multiple of *both* 3 and 5, the program ignores the previous 2 rules and returns the message 'Fizzbuzz'.
* In all other cases, the program simply returns the given number.

> FizzBuzz task **completed** with all unit tests passing/green.
